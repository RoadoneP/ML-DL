Standford CS231n Summary
------------------------

After watching all the videos of the famous Standford's CS231n course that took place in 2021, I decided to summarize the entire lecture for those who want to remember the content and learn more about it.

EDA & FE
--------

> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach/philosophy for data analysis that employs a variety of techniques (mostly graphical) to

ML (Using Skitlearn)
====================

-	### [DecisionTree, RandomForest](https://github.com/RoadoneP/ML-DL/tree/main/Machine_laerning/DecisionTree%2CRandomForest)
	-	It is a supervised learning method used for classification and regression.
	-	Predict values ​​through decision rules inferred from data characteristics.
	-	Learning data through if-then-else decision rules.
	-	The deeper the tree, the more complex the model.
	-	Advantages of decision trees Easy to understand and interpret.
	-	It does not require much data preprocessing.
	-	It can handle both numeric and categorical data. �� ![](./image/DT.png)
-	### [SVM](https://github.com/RoadoneP/ML-DL/tree/main/Machine_laerning/SVM)

	-	Supervised learning methods used for regression, classification, and outlier detection
	-	Data points located on the boundary between classes are called support vectors.
	-	Learn how important each support vector is in demarcating decision boundaries between classes.
